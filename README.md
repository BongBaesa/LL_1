# Learning Laravel Basics Journey

This repository documents my first steps in learning **Laravel**, focusing on the basics and key features for creating web applications. Itâ€™s been a fun yet chaotic experience diving into a new framework, but Iâ€™m excited to continue learning and practicing PHP frameworks. Iâ€™m determined to keep pushing forward, expanding my logical thinking, and building more complex applications!

## Introduction
I started by learning about **Laravel**, how it works, and why itâ€™s so popular for building web applications.

## Installation
I set up Laravel using **Composer** and configured the environment with the `.env` file.

## Routing & Controllers
I learned how to define routes in `web.php` and connect them to controllers to handle requests.

## Blade Templating
I got hands-on with **Blade** for creating dynamic views and reusable layouts.

## Database & Models
I worked with **migrations** to set up databases and **Eloquent** to interact with the data.

## Authentication
I implemented **Laravel Breeze** to set up simple authentication, including user login and registration.

## Eloquent ORM
I dived into **Eloquent ORM** to easily query and interact with the database and define relationships between models.

## Error & Bug Management with Laravel Handbook
While building the app, I followed the **[Laravel Handbook](https://flaviocopes.pages.dev/books/laravel-handbook.pdf)** and managed to view and handle errors and bugs during development.

## Testing on Local Development
I tested my Laravel application locally using the following basic commands:

- **`php artisan serve`**: I ran the development server with this command to serve the application locally on `http://localhost:8000`.
- **`npm run dev`**: For compiling assets like CSS and JavaScript, I used this command to start the Laravel Mix process, enabling me to see real-time changes as I worked on the front-end.

These tools are crucial for local development, enabling quick testing and iteration, while ensuring the app runs smoothly before production.

## Conclusion
This process has familiarized me with Laravel basics. I'm still a novice ðŸ˜–, but excited to explore advanced features as I **continue improving!**
